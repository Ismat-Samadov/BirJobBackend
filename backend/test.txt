Certainly! Here are some curl commands to help you test your API endpoints:

### 1. Register a User
bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword",
    "is_recruiter": false
}'


### 2. Login a User
bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "testpassword"
}'


This will return a JWT token, which you will use for authorization in the following requests.

### 3. List All Job Posts
bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/jobs/ \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"


Replace your-access-token with the access token you received from the login command.

### 4. Create a Job Post (Requires Recruiter Login)
bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/jobs/create/ \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "title": "Software Engineer",
    "description": "Job description for a software engineer.",
    "company": "Tech Company",
    "location": "New York, NY",
    "function": "Engineering",
    "schedule": "Full-time",
    "deadline": "2024-12-31",
    "responsibilities": "Develop and maintain software applications.",
    "requirements": "2+ years of experience in software development.",

}'

-F "full_name=John Doe" \
-F "email=johndoe@example.com" \
-F "phone=1234567890" \
-F "cover_letter=I am interested in this job because..." \
-F "resume=@/path/to/your/resume.pdf"


Replace 1 in the URL with the actual job ID you want to apply for, and /path/to/your/resume.pdf with the actual path to your resume file.
